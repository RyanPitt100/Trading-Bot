# Trading-Bot
A quick python project that uses the Krakenex API to display crypto-currency information and allows user to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Additional functionality is being worked on which will allow the program to execute a pre-programmed trading strategy.

I do not recommend trading cryptocurrencies and would not endorse using an automated trading program like this one. This was built out of personal interest in how they automated trading bots work.
